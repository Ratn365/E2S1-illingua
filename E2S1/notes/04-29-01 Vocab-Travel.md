### Step 3: Practice Exercises for Speaking

To improve your speaking, practice these terms in context. Below are exercises tailored to your role and intermediate level:

1. **Role-Play: Airport Check-in**  
   Imagine you’re at the check-in desk for a business trip. Practice this dialogue aloud:
   - **You**: Hello, I’m checking in for the 10 AM flight to Singapore. (Use “check-in desk” and “departure.”)
   - **Staff**: Can I see your passport and boarding pass? (Respond with “passport” and “boarding pass.”)
   - **You**: Here’s my passport. I’d like a window seat, please. (Use “window seat.”)

2. **Sentence Creation**  
   Create one positive, negative, interrogative, and WH-question sentence for each term. For example, for “security”:
   - Positive: Security checks are thorough at this airport.
   - Negative: Security didn’t allow my water bottle.
   - Interrogative: Is security open now?
   - WH-Question: What do I need for security?

3. **Describe a Trip**  
   Narrate a fictional business trip using at least 5 terms. Example:  
   “Last week, I traveled to Dubai for a supplier meeting. I arrived at the check-in desk early and got my boarding pass. After passing through security, I waited at Gate 10B. I chose a window seat to relax. At customs, I used the green channel since I had nothing to declare.”

### Step 4: Tips for Improving Speaking

1. **Practice Daily**: Use apps like Duolingo or BBC Learning English to practice travel-related phrases.
2. **Record Yourself**: Say the example sentences and listen to improve pronunciation.
3. **Use Hindi as a Bridge**: Translate difficult terms to Hindi to build confidence, then switch to English.
4. **Join a Speaking Group**: Find online English-speaking groups or colleagues to practice travel scenarios.
5. **Watch Travel Videos**: Watch YouTube videos about airport procedures to hear terms in context.

---

### Step 5: Addressing Your Assessment

Since your teacher assessed you as an intermediate speaker, focus on:
- **Fluency**: Practice speaking without pausing too long. Use the role-play exercise.
- **Vocabulary**: Memorize the 12 terms above and use them in sentences daily.
- **Pronunciation**: Pay attention to words like “departure” (di-PAR-chur) and “passport” (PASS-port).
- **Confidence**: Start with simple sentences, then combine terms (e.g., “I showed my passport at the check-in desk.”)

---

### Step 6: Additional Notes

- The document’s exercises (e.g., matching terms to pictures, answering questions) can help reinforce vocabulary. Practice them aloud to improve speaking.
- If you travel for work, keep a small notebook with these terms and practice them at airports.
- If you want to forget this conversation later, you can manage it by clicking the book icon beneath the message and selecting this chat, or disable memory in “Data Controls” in settings.

### Practice Exercise 4 (Fill in the Blanks - Trans-Siberian Railway)
Fill in the missing words in the article:
- The Trans-Siberian is one of the world’s famous railroads. To make the 9,289-kilometer trip across Russia, you normally have to spend almost seven days on the **train** (1). However, you can now enjoy the view from a **window** (2) **seat** (3) for the full Trans-Siberian trip, from Moscow to Vladivostok, without paying a **fare** (4). The trip is possible, thanks to a joint project by Russian Railways and Google. A video of the whole route, filmed from the window of one of the train’s **coaches** (5), is available on Google Maps. The video is in sections, with a moving map that shows where each section is. This allows you to choose different points of **departure** (6) to begin parts of the trip. And, as you look out of your virtual window, you can listen to different soundtracks: the train’s wheels rumbling along the **track** (7), Russian radio, or a reading of *War and Peace*.

**Procurement Context**: If you were sourcing materials from Russia, you might research travel options like the Trans-Siberian Railway.

### Tips for Hindi Speakers
- **Hindi Influence**: Hindi uses general terms for travel (e.g., "हवाई अड्डा" /hawai adda/ = airport), but English has specific terms (e.g., "check-in desk," "gate"). Learn these distinctions.
- **Word Order**: Hindi uses Subject-Object-Verb (e.g., "मैंने पासपोर्ट दिखाया" = "I passport showed"). English uses Subject-Verb-Object: "I showed my passport."
- **Pronunciation**: Practice terms like "boarding pass" /ˈbɔːrdɪŋ pæs/ and "passport control" /ˈpæspɔːrt kənˈtroʊl/ to avoid merging sounds.
- **Prepositions**: English uses specific prepositions (e.g., "at the gate," "through security"). Hindi may use postpositions (e.g., "गेट पर" /gate par/), but English prepositions are fixed.
