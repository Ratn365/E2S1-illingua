 These structures align with the materials from "04-10 U-2 KP 1.3.pdf".

### Understanding "When" and "If"
- **"When"**: Used for situations that are certain or habitual—something that always or usually happens under a specific condition.
  - Example: "When it rains, I get wet."
- **"If"**: Used for hypothetical or possible situations—something that might happen under certain conditions.
  - Example: "If it rains, I will take an umbrella."
- Both are common in daily communication and can be applied to your professional and personal life as a procurement manager.

The exercises use "when" and "if" interchangeably in questions (e.g., "When/If you don’t brush your teeth?"), suggesting flexibility. However, I’ll clarify based on context and provide answers accordingly.

### Exercise 1: What happens...
This exercise asks you to complete sentences using "when" or "if" to describe outcomes. The example provided is: "What happens when you remove ice from the freezer? - When I remove ice from the freezer, it melts." I’ll follow this pattern, using the **Simple Present** tense for habitual actions (as seen in the documents), and provide answers for each question.

#### 1. What happens when you don’t brush your teeth daily?
- **Answer**: When I don’t brush my teeth daily, my teeth get dirty.
- **Explanation**: "When" fits here as it describes a habitual outcome. This is a general situation you might face.
- **Examples**:
  - **Positive**: When I brush my teeth daily, my mouth feels fresh.
  - **Negative**: When I don’t brush my teeth, my breath smells bad.
  - **Interrogative**: Do your teeth hurt when you don’t brush them?
  - **WH-Question**: Why do your teeth get dirty when you don’t brush them?

#### 2. What happens when you spill coffee on your laptop?
- **Answer**: When I spill coffee on my laptop, it stops working.
- **Explanation**: "When" is appropriate for a likely outcome in a specific situation, aligning with the habitual context of the exercise.
- **Examples**:
  - **Positive**: When I clean the spill quickly, my laptop works fine.
  - **Negative**: When I don’t wipe the coffee, the laptop gets damaged.
  - **Interrogative**: Does your laptop crash when you spill coffee?
  - **WH-Question**: What happens to your laptop when you spill coffee?

#### 3. What happens when you sleep late at night?
- **Answer**: When I sleep late at night, I feel tired in the morning.
- **Explanation**: "When" reflects a regular consequence of a habitual action.
- **Examples**:
  - **Positive**: When I sleep early, I wake up refreshed.
  - **Negative**: When I don’t sleep enough, I can’t focus at work.
  - **Interrogative**: Do you feel sleepy when you sleep late?
  - **WH-Question**: Why do you feel tired when you sleep late?

#### 4. What happens when you don’t study for a test?
- **Answer**: When I don’t study for a test, I fail it.
- **Explanation**: "When" is used for a predictable outcome based on a habitual or repeated action.
- **Examples**:
  - **Positive**: When I study hard, I pass the test.
  - **Negative**: When I don’t prepare, I don’t understand the questions.
  - **Interrogative**: Do you fail when you don’t study?
  - **WH-Question**: What happens to your score when you don’t study?

#### 5. What happens when you fall from a tree?
- **Answer**: When I fall from a tree, I get hurt.
- **Explanation**: "When" suits this as it describes a likely result of a specific action, treated as a general possibility here.
- **Examples**:
  - **Positive**: When I climb carefully, I avoid falling.
  - **Negative**: When I don’t hold on, I fall from the tree.
  - **Interrogative**: Do you get injured when you fall?
  - **WH-Question**: How do you feel when you fall from a tree?

### Comparison with the Uploaded Image
The image provides additional "What happens..." questions for Partners A and B, which overlap with Exercise 1 (e.g., "When/If you don’t study for a test?" and "When/If you spill coffee on your laptop?"). The structure is consistent, using "when" or "if" to prompt responses about outcomes. Here’s how they align:
- **Overlap**: Questions like "When/If you don’t study for a test?" and "When/If you spill coffee on your laptop?" match Exercise 1, items 2 and 4.
- **Difference**: The image includes more personal scenarios (e.g., "When/If you get bitten by a mosquito?"), while Exercise 1 focuses on daily habits and risks.

For consistency with your homework, I’ve focused on Exercise 1, but you can apply the same approach to the image’s questions. For example:
- "When/If you get bitten by a mosquito?" → When I get bitten by a mosquito, I feel itchy.

### Exercise 2: Interview a friend/family member/colleague about their daily routine
This exercise encourages you to practice speaking and using the **Simple Present** tense (for routines) and possibly **Present Continuous** (for current actions). Since it involves asking questions, I’ll suggest WH-questions and yes/no questions based on the "Simple Present and Continuous.pdf" document you worked with earlier.

#### Suggested Questions:
1. **What do you do every morning?**
   - Example Answer: I brush my teeth and have breakfast.
2. **Do you work every day?**
   - Example Answer: Yes, I work from 9 to 5.
3. **When do you eat lunch?**
   - Example Answer: I eat lunch at 1 PM.
4. **Are you working now?**
   - Example Answer: No, I am relaxing now.
5. **Why do you go to bed late?**
   - Example Answer: I go to bed late because I watch TV.

#### Tips for the Interview:
- Use **Simple Present** for habits (e.g., "Do you check emails daily?").
- Use **Present Continuous** if asking about the moment (e.g., "Are you eating now?").
- Record the answers and practice repeating them to improve pronunciation, especially **-s** endings (e.g., "works" /wɜːrks/).
- Relate to your context: Ask a colleague, “Do you review contracts every day?” or “Are you negotiating with a supplier now?”

### Application to Your Role and Language Needs
- **Professional Use**: As a procurement manager, you can use "when" and "if" to discuss outcomes:
  - "When I review contracts, I find errors."
  - "If the supplier delays, I will find another."
- **Hindi Influence**: Hindi uses "जब" (jab) for "when" and "अगर" (agar) for "if," which are similar. Ensure you add the correct tense in English (e.g., "When I don’t study" vs. Hindi "जब मैं नहीं पढ़ता").
- **Practice**: Try answering the questions with your own experiences (e.g., "When I don’t sleep, I feel tired at work").

### Practice Exercise
1. Write answers to the image’s Partner A questions (e.g., "When it rains and you don’t have an umbrella?") using the pattern from Exercise 1.
   - Example: When it rains and I don’t have an umbrella, I get wet.
2. Create 3 WH-questions about a colleague’s routine using "when" or "if" (e.g., "When do you check supplier emails?").
