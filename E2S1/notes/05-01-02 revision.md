### Tips for Hindi Speakers
- **Hindi Influence (Past Continuous)**: Hindi uses a similar structure for ongoing actions (e.g., "मैं काम कर रहा था" /main kaam kar raha tha/ = "I was working"), but English requires "was/were + -ing." Avoid dropping "was/were" (e.g., wrong: "I working").
- **Hindi Influence (Present Perfect)**: Hindi often uses past tense for experiences (e.g., "मैंने पहाड़ चढ़ा" /mainne pahad chadha/ = "I climbed a mountain"). Use "have/has + past participle" in English: "I have climbed a mountain."
- **Word Order**: Hindi uses Subject-Object-Verb (e.g., "मैं रिपोर्ट लिख रहा था" = "I report writing was"). English uses Subject-Verb-Object: "I was writing a report."
- **Pronunciation**: Practice Past Continuous (e.g., "was preparing" /wəz prɪˈpeərɪŋ/) and Present Perfect contractions (e.g., "I’ve" /aɪv/) to sound natural.
