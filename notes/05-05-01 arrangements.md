### 9. Making Arrangements with Time Clauses (From "05-05 U-7 K.P 7.1.pdf")

#### Concept: Using "Will" with Time Clauses for Future Arrangements
The document teaches how to make arrangements using "will" for future actions, often paired with time clauses like:
- **When**: For a specific point in time when something happens.
- **As soon as**: For immediate actions after something happens.
- **Until**: For something that continues up to a certain point.
- **Before**: For something that happens prior to another event.
- **Shall/Will**: For offering or confirming actions (common in British English for "shall").

The structure typically combines **Present Simple** in the time clause (e.g., "when I arrive") with **"will"** in the main clause for the future action (e.g., "I’ll call you").

#### When to Use:
- Use this structure when you’re making arrangements or confirming what will happen after a specific condition is met.
  - Example: "I’ll send the purchase order as soon as I get the budget approval." (The action depends on the condition being met.)

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
As a procurement manager, you often need to coordinate actions based on specific conditions, such as waiting for approvals, deliveries, or meetings. This structure helps you clearly communicate these plans.

#### Examples in Your Professional Context:
- **Positive**:
  - "I’ll email the supplier when I receive the invoice."
    - (Present Simple: "when I receive"; Future: "I’ll email")
- **Negative**:
  - "I won’t order the materials until you confirm the budget."
    - (Present Simple: "until you confirm"; Future: "I won’t order")
- **Interrogative**:
  - "Will you send the contract as soon as you finish the review?"
    - (Present Simple: "as soon as you finish"; Future: "Will you send")
- **WH-Question**:
  - "When will you finalize the vendor list before the meeting starts?"
    - (Present Simple: "before the meeting starts"; Future: "will you finalize")

### 10. Using "Shall" for Offers or Suggestions (From Listening 7.1)
The document uses "shall" in the question "Shall I send you the dates for that?" This is a formal way to make an offer or suggestion, often used in British English. In your role, you might use this to politely offer assistance or confirm actions with colleagues or vendors.

#### When to Use "Shall":
- To make polite offers or suggestions, especially in formal or professional settings.
  - Example: "Shall I call the supplier to confirm the delivery date?" (Offering to take action.)

#### Examples in Your Professional Context:
- **Positive**:
  - "Shall I prepare the CAPEX report for the meeting?"
    - (Offering to take action.)
- **Negative**:
  - "Shall I not include this vendor in the list?"
    - (Suggesting exclusion, though less common in negative form.)
- **Interrogative**:
  - "Shall I schedule the audit for next week?"
    - (Making a suggestion.)
- **WH-Question**:
  - "When shall I send you the updated procurement plan?"
    - (Asking for timing while offering to send.)

### Tips for Hindi Speakers:
- In Hindi, you might say "जब मैं मंजूरी लूँगा, मैं ऑर्डर भेजूँगा" ("When I get approval, I’ll send the order"). In English, the time clause ("when I get") uses Present Simple, not future tense, even though the action is in the future. This is a key difference to practice.
- "Shall" might feel formal, but it’s useful in professional emails or conversations to sound polite. In Hindi, you might use "क्या मैं..." (e.g., "क्या मैं सप्लायर को कॉल करूँ?"), which translates to "Shall I call the supplier?"

- **Time Clause with "Until"**: "I won’t finalize the budget until you approve the expenses."
- **Offer with "Shall"**: "Shall I email the supplier to confirm the delivery date?"
- **WH-Question**: "When will you review the contract before I send it to the legal team?"
