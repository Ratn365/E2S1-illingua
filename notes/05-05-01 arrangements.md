### 9. Making Arrangements with Time Clauses (From "05-05 U-7 K.P 7.1.pdf")

#### Concept: Using "Will" with Time Clauses for Future Arrangements
The document teaches how to make arrangements using "will" for future actions, often paired with time clauses like:
- **When**: For a specific point in time when something happens.
- **As soon as**: For immediate actions after something happens.
- **Until**: For something that continues up to a certain point.
- **Before**: For something that happens prior to another event.
- **Shall/Will**: For offering or confirming actions (common in British English for "shall").

The structure typically combines **Present Simple** in the time clause (e.g., "when I arrive") with **"will"** in the main clause for the future action (e.g., "I’ll call you").

#### When to Use:
- Use this structure when you’re making arrangements or confirming what will happen after a specific condition is met.
  - Example: "I’ll send the purchase order as soon as I get the budget approval." (The action depends on the condition being met.)

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
As a procurement manager, you often need to coordinate actions based on specific conditions, such as waiting for approvals, deliveries, or meetings. This structure helps you clearly communicate these plans.

#### Examples in Your Professional Context:
- **Positive**:
  - "I’ll email the supplier when I receive the invoice."
    - (Present Simple: "when I receive"; Future: "I’ll email")
- **Negative**:
  - "I won’t order the materials until you confirm the budget."
    - (Present Simple: "until you confirm"; Future: "I won’t order")
- **Interrogative**:
  - "Will you send the contract as soon as you finish the review?"
    - (Present Simple: "as soon as you finish"; Future: "Will you send")
- **WH-Question**:
  - "When will you finalize the vendor list before the meeting starts?"
    - (Present Simple: "before the meeting starts"; Future: "will you finalize")

### 10. Using "Shall" for Offers or Suggestions (From Listening 7.1)
The document uses "shall" in the question "Shall I send you the dates for that?" This is a formal way to make an offer or suggestion, often used in British English. In your role, you might use this to politely offer assistance or confirm actions with colleagues or vendors.

#### When to Use "Shall":
- To make polite offers or suggestions, especially in formal or professional settings.
  - Example: "Shall I call the supplier to confirm the delivery date?" (Offering to take action.)

#### Examples in Your Professional Context:
- **Positive**:
  - "Shall I prepare the CAPEX report for the meeting?"
    - (Offering to take action.)
- **Negative**:
  - "Shall I not include this vendor in the list?"
    - (Suggesting exclusion, though less common in negative form.)
- **Interrogative**:
  - "Shall I schedule the audit for next week?"
    - (Making a suggestion.)
- **WH-Question**:
  - "When shall I send you the updated procurement plan?"
    - (Asking for timing while offering to send.)

#### Exercise 2: Use Time Clauses in a Blog (Based on Practice Exercise 2)
Complete this short blog about your procurement plans using "when," "as soon as," "until," and "before":

#### Exercise 3: Make Polite Offers with "Shall"
Create sentences using "shall" to offer help in your procurement tasks:
- **Positive**: "Shall I contact the supplier for a price quote?"
- **Negative**: "Shall I not include the delayed items in the order?"
- **Interrogative**: "Shall I arrange a meeting with the vendor?"
- **WH-Question**: "When shall I schedule the delivery inspection?"

### Tips for Hindi Speakers:
- In Hindi, you might say "जब मैं मंजूरी लूँगा, मैं ऑर्डर भेजूँगा" ("When I get approval, I’ll send the order"). In English, the time clause ("when I get") uses Present Simple, not future tense, even though the action is in the future. This is a key difference to practice.
- "Shall" might feel formal, but it’s useful in professional emails or conversations to sound polite. In Hindi, you might use "क्या मैं..." (e.g., "क्या मैं सप्लायर को कॉल करूँ?"), which translates to "Shall I call the supplier?"

### Final Scenario in Your Role:
Imagine you’re coordinating a procurement project. Use the structures to communicate your plans:
- **Time Clause with "Will"**: "I’ll submit the purchase order as soon as I receive the vendor’s confirmation."
- **Time Clause with "Until"**: "I won’t finalize the budget until you approve the expenses."
- **Offer with "Shall"**: "Shall I email the supplier to confirm the delivery date?"
- **WH-Question**: "When will you review the contract before I send it to the legal team?"

 
# 7.2 Describing Arrangements  

#### Concept: Using Present Continuous for Arrangements vs. Present Simple for Timetables
We’ve already covered Present Continuous for arrangements and Present Simple for timetables, but the document provides a specific example in the form of an email about an intercultural training course. This is relevant to your role when you arrange meetings, site visits, or training sessions for your team.

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
- **Email Example (Adapted)**: Imagine you’re emailing a colleague about a procurement training session:
  - "Hi Ravi, I’ve made arrangements for our procurement training. The session starts on Wednesday, May 14, and ends on Friday, May 16. Our flight leaves at 7 a.m. on Wednesday. I am meeting the trainer at the airport at 9 a.m."

#### Practice Exercise (Based on Follow-up 7.2):
Using the email example above, fill in a table for the procurement training:
1. Training start date: ____________
   - Answer: May 14
2. Training end date: ____________
   - Answer: May 16
3. Flight departure time: ____________
   - Answer: 7 a.m.

#### Examples in Your Context:
- **Positive (Present Continuous)**: "I am meeting the trainer at 9 a.m. at the airport."
- **Negative (Present Simple)**: "The training session doesn’t start until Wednesday."
- **Interrogative (Present Continuous)**: "Are you attending the procurement training next week?"
- **WH-Question (Present Simple)**: "What time does the flight leave on Wednesday?"

### 8. Conversation Cards (From "Let’s Talk About the Future.pdf")

#### Concept: Using "Will" and "Going To" for Predictions and Plans
The "Let’s Talk About the Future" document includes conversation cards with questions about predictions (using "will") and plans (using "going to"). This can help you practice discussing future trends in procurement, such as price changes or supply chain innovations.

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
- **Prediction Question**: "Do you think material prices will rise next year?"
  - Answer: "Yes, I think prices will rise because of inflation."
- **Plan Question**: "What are you going to do about the rising costs?"
  - Answer: "I am going to negotiate better terms with our suppliers."

#### Practice Exercise (Adapted for Procurement):
Answer these questions about your work:
1. Do you think robots will replace human buyers in procurement in the future? Why/Why not?
   - Example Answer: "I don’t think robots will fully replace buyers because human judgment is still important for negotiations."
2. What are you going to do this weekend to prepare for next week’s procurement tasks?
   - Example Answer: "I am going to review the vendor contracts this weekend."

#### Examples in Your Context:
- **Positive (Will)**: "I think the new supplier will deliver on time."
- **Negative (Going To)**: "I am not going to order from that vendor again."
- **Interrogative (Will)**: "Will the new system improve our procurement process?"
- **WH-Question (Going To)**: "What are you going to do if the supplier delays again?"

### Tips for Hindi Speakers:
- Hindi often uses a single future tense (e.g., "मैं करूँगा" for both spontaneous and planned actions), but English requires you to choose between "will," "going to," Present Continuous, and Present Simple based on context. Practice identifying the timing of the decision or event.
- For timetables, think of fixed schedules like train timings in India (e.g., "ट्रेन 5 बजे आती है" translates to "The train arrives at 5 p.m." in Present Simple).

### Final Practice Scenario:
Imagine you’re planning a procurement strategy meeting. Use all structures to create a short conversation:
- **Timetable (Present Simple)**: "The meeting room opens at 9 a.m. tomorrow."
- **Arrangement (Present Continuous)**: "I am presenting the CAPEX budget at 10 a.m."
- **Planned Action (Going To)**: "We are going to discuss new vendors after lunch."
- **Spontaneous Decision (Will)**: "Oh, I forgot the slides—I’ll print them now."
