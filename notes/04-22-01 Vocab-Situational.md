   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: I’ve just arrived at the supplier’s office for a meeting.
   - **Negative**: I haven’t just arrived; I’ve been here for an hour.
   - **Interrogative**: Have you just arrived at the warehouse?
   - **WH-Question**: Why have you just arrived so late?

   **Situations**:
   - **Professional (Procurement)**: Explaining your presence or delays. E.g., “I only arrived a few minutes ago due to traffic.”
   - **Everyday**: Greeting someone. E.g., “I’ve just arrived at the party.”
   - **Tip**: Use “just” for emphasis on recency (e.g., “I’ve just called the supplier”).

#### B. Verb Tenses: Present Perfect vs. Past Simple
The document emphasizes the **present perfect** (have/has + past participle) for events with ongoing relevance and the **past simple** (verb + -ed or irregular form) for completed events. These are used with the time expressions above.

1. **Present Perfect (e.g., I’ve just started, I haven’t seen)**
   - **Meaning**: Describes actions that happened recently and still affect the present.
   - **Usage**: Common with “recently,” “lately,” “just,” “in the last few days.”
   - **Hindi Equivalent**: Often translated as completed actions with current impact, e.g., “Maine abhi kiya” (मैंने अभी किया).

   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: I’ve just finished negotiating with a supplier.
   - **Negative**: We haven’t received the shipment lately.
   - **Interrogative**: Have you seen the new price list recently?
   - **WH-Question**: What have you done in the last few days to improve costs?

   **Situations**:
   - **Professional (Procurement)**: Reporting recent actions. E.g., “I’ve just signed a contract.”
   - **Everyday**: Sharing updates. E.g., “I’ve recently bought a new phone.”
   - **Tip**: Use present perfect for actions without a specific time or with ongoing effects.

2. **Past Simple (e.g., I started, It happened)**
   - **Meaning**: Describes actions completed in the past with no current relevance.
   - **Usage**: Common with “a few days ago,” “last week,” “it wasn’t long ago.”
   - **Hindi Equivalent**: Simple past, e.g., “Maine kiya” (मैंने किया) for a specific time.

   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: I met a supplier last week.
   - **Negative**: We didn’t finalize the deal a few days ago.
   - **Interrogative**: Did you visit the factory in the last few days?
   - **WH-Question**: What happened during the past weeks at work?

   **Situations**:
   - **Professional (Procurement)**: Describing past events. E.g., “It wasn’t long ago that we changed vendors.”
   - **Everyday**: Talking about past experiences. E.g., “I went to Mumbai last month.”
   - **Tip**: Use past simple for specific times or completed actions.

### 2. Situational Usage and Practical Applications

As a procurement manager, you often discuss recent supplier updates, market changes, or project progress, where these structures are highly relevant. Below, I’ll explain how to use them in professional and everyday contexts, tailored to your role and intermediate level.

#### Professional Contexts (Procurement)
- **Supplier Updates**: Use “recently,” “lately,” “in the last few days” with present perfect to report ongoing activities.
  - Example: “I’ve just negotiated a better price with a supplier.”
- **Meetings and Reports**: Use “it wasn’t long ago” or “during the past weeks” with past simple for completed events.
  - Example: “It wasn’t long ago that we signed a new contract.”
- **Urgent Updates**: Use “it’s just happened” or “I’ve just arrived” for immediate news.
  - Example: “It’s just happened—the vendor approved our terms.”
- **Market Trends**: Combine tenses with time expressions to sound professional.
  - Example: “In the last few days, prices have risen, but we finalized a deal last week.”

**Tips for Professional Use**:
- Practice short sentences for emails: “I’ve recently contacted a new supplier.”
- Use present perfect for ongoing projects: “We’ve just started a new tender process.”
- Use past simple for timelines: “We met the vendor last week.”

#### Everyday Contexts
- **Personal Updates**: Use “recently,” “lately,” “just” to share news.
  - Example: “I’ve just booked a trip to Jaipur.”
- **Social Conversations**: Use “in the last few days” or “it wasn’t long ago” to talk about experiences.
  - Example: “It wasn’t long ago that I watched a great movie.”
- **News Discussions**: Use present perfect for breaking news, past simple for past events.
  - Example: “India has just won a cricket match!” or “They played well last week.”
- **Daily Routines**: Use “I’ve just arrived” or “during the past weeks” for casual updates.
  - Example: “I’ve just arrived at the market.”

**Tips for Everyday Use**:
- Practice with familiar topics like cricket or family events to build fluency.
- Use “just” to sound excited: “I’ve just seen the news!”
- Relate to local events: “In the last few days, the weather was bad.”

### 3. Practice Exercises (From the Document)

The document includes two practice exercises to reinforce the structures. I’ll explain each, provide answers, and show how to use the structures in sentences, tailored to your needs.

#### Practice Exercise 1 (Page 2)
**Task**: Complete a conversation between Tim and Alice about Tim’s new job, using the correct verb tense (present perfect or past simple).

**Answers** (from Page 3):
1. Have you started
2. I’ve been
3. went
4. were you
5. was
6. had
7. I spent
8. met
9. took
10. showed
11. saw
12. you didn’t do

**Conversation with Answers**:
- A: So, **have you started** the new job yet?
- B: Yes, **I’ve been** there just over a week.
- A: Is it going OK?
- B: Not too bad. The first week **went** well, anyway.
- A: So **were you** in at the deep end on day one?
- B: No, not really. It **was** a fairly gentle start, actually. **I had** a training course on the first day—a sort of introductory course, for new staff. Then **I spent** a day in the office, and **met** everyone there. They seem like a good bunch of people. Then someone **took** me to the plant and **showed** me around, and **I saw** some of the people there.
