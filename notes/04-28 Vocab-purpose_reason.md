### 1. Grammar Structures and Usage

The document focuses on structures for explaining **purposes** (why something is used) and **reasons** (why something happens). I’ll explain each structure, its meaning, pronunciation (simplified for Hindi speakers), and usage. For each, I’ll provide:
- **Positive**, **negative**, **interrogative**, and **WH-question** sentences.
- **Situations**: Professional (procurement) and everyday contexts.
- **Tips for Hindi Speakers**: Relate to Hindi equivalents for clarity.

#### A. Structures for Purpose
These structures explain the purpose of an action or object (e.g., why you use a device).

1. **To / In Order To** (e.g., "Memory sticks are used to store files")
   - **Meaning**: Indicates the purpose of an action.
   - **Pronunciation**:
     - "To": /TOO/ (short and simple).
     - "In order to": /IN OR-der TOO/ (stress on "OR-der").
   - **Usage**: "To" is more common; "in order to" is slightly more formal.
   - **Hindi Equivalent**: "के लिए" (ke liye) or "ताकि" (taaki), e.g., "Main laptop use karta hoon kaam ke liye" (मैं लैपटॉप यूज़ करता हूँ काम के लिए).

   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: I use a laptop to manage my procurement tasks.
   - **Negative**: I don’t use my phone to store sensitive files.
   - **Interrogative**: Do you use a tablet to browse the internet?
   - **WH-Question**: What do you use your computer to do?

   **Situations**:
   - **Professional (Procurement)**: Explaining tool usage. E.g., "I use software to track supplier orders."
   - **Everyday**: Describing device use. E.g., "I use my phone to take photos."
   - **Tip**: Use "to" for simple purposes; "in order to" for emphasis or formal contexts.

2. **For + Verb-ing** (e.g., "Memory sticks are used for storing files")
   - **Meaning**: Describes what something is used for (focus on the activity).
   - **Pronunciation**: "For": /FOR/ (short and simple); stress the verb-ing, e.g., "STOR-ing" (/STOR-ing/).
   - **Usage**: Common for describing the function of objects.
   - **Hindi Equivalent**: "के लिए" (ke liye), e.g., "Yeh pen likhne ke liye hai" (ये पेन लिखने के लिए है).

   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: This software is used for managing inventory.
   - **Negative**: This device isn’t used for sending emails.
   - **Interrogative**: Is this tablet used for surfing the internet?
   - **WH-Question**: What is this app used for doing?

   **Situations**:
   - **Professional (Procurement)**: Describing tools. E.g., "This app is used for tracking shipments."
   - **Everyday**: Talking about gadgets. E.g., "My smartwatch is used for tracking steps."
   - **Tip**: Use "for + verb-ing" when talking about the purpose of an object.

3. **So That / So** (e.g., "You should back up your files so that you don’t lose them")
   - **Meaning**: Explains the intended result of an action.
   - **Pronunciation**:
     - "So that": /SO THAT/ (stress on "SO").
     - "So": /SO/ (short and simple).
   - **Usage**: "So that" is followed by a clause; "so" is more informal and often implies the result.
   - **Hindi Equivalent**: "ताकि" (taaki), e.g., "Main backup karta hoon taaki files na khoyen" (मैं बैकअप करता हूँ ताकि फाइल्स न खोएँ).

   **Examples**:
   - **Positive**: I save my files on a cloud so that I don’t lose them.
   - **Negative**: I didn’t charge my laptop so that it wouldn’t overheat (formal tone).
   - **Interrogative**: Did you back up your data so that you wouldn’t lose it?
   - **WH-Question**: Why do you use a password so that nobody can access your files?

   **Situations**:
