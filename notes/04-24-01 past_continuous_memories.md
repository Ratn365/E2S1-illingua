# 4.3: Talking about Memories
 
---

### Overview of the Lesson
The documents focus on **talking about memories**, specifically using the **past continuous tense** (was/were + verb-ing) to describe ongoing actions in the past, often interrupted by another event (in the past simple). They also introduce the concept of **flashbulb memories**—vivid recollections of significant events. The materials include:

- **Structures**: Using "when" and "while" with past continuous and past simple (e.g., "I was driving when I heard the news").
- **Reading**: An article on flashbulb memories and their characteristics.
- **Visual Exercise (K.P. 4.3)**: A scene of an accident with characters, followed by a sentence completion task.
- **Grammar Practice Sheet**: A past continuous exercise about Jake and his father’s activities last Saturday.
- **Practice Exercises**: Listening to a memory of JFK’s assassination, completing sentences, and analyzing a news story about a pilot’s crash.

This lesson will:
1. Explain the past continuous tense, the use of "when" and "while," and related vocabulary (e.g., flashbulb memory).
2. Provide sentence examples (positive, negative, interrogative, WH-questions) for each structure.
3. Describe situations where these structures are used, especially in procurement and everyday contexts.
4. Use the document’s exercises and visual content to reinforce learning.
5. Offer tips for improving your English speaking skills as an intermediate learner.

### 1. Structures and Usage

The document focuses on the **past continuous tense** (was/were + verb-ing) to describe ongoing actions in the past, often interrupted by another event in the **past simple** (e.g., "I heard"). The conjunctions "when" and "while" connect these actions. I’ll explain the structure, its meaning, pronunciation (simplified for Hindi speakers), and usage. For each, I’ll provide:
- **Positive**, **negative**, **interrogative**, and **WH-question** sentences.
- **Situations**: Professional (procurement) and everyday contexts.
- **Tips for Hindi Speakers**: Relate to Hindi equivalents for clarity.

#### A. Past Continuous with "When" and "While"
- **Structure**: 
  - **I was [verb-ing] when [past simple event happened]** (e.g., "I was driving when I heard the news").
  - **When [past simple event happened], I was [verb-ing]** (e.g., "When I heard the news, I was driving").
  - **While I was [verb-ing], [past simple event happened]** (e.g., "While I was driving, I heard the news").
- **Meaning**: Describes an ongoing action in the past (past continuous) interrupted by a shorter, completed action (past simple).
- **Pronunciation**:
  - "When": /WEN/ (short and simple).
  - "While": /WILE/ (rhymes with "smile").
  - Past continuous: Stress the verb, e.g., "I was DRIV-ing" (/I wuz DRIV-ing/).
- **Usage**: Used to set the scene for a memory or event, often with "when" or "while" to show the interruption.
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Similar to using "jab" (जब) or "jabki" (जबकि) with ongoing actions, e.g., "Main gadi chala raha tha jab mujhe khabar sunai di" (मैं गाड़ी चला रहा था जब मुझे खबर सुनाई दी).

**Examples**:
1. **Positive**: I was negotiating with a supplier when the client called me.
2. **Negative**: We weren’t discussing the contract when the manager arrived.
3. **Interrogative**: Were you working on the tender when the power went off?
4. **WH-Question**: What were you doing when the shipment arrived?

**Situations**:
- **Professional (Procurement)**: Describing interruptions during work. E.g., "I was reviewing a proposal when the supplier emailed me."
- **Everyday**: Recalling past events. E.g., "I was watching cricket when my friend called."
- **Tip**: Use "when" for the interrupting event, "while" for the ongoing action. In Hindi, think of "jab" for "when" and "jabki" for "while."

#### B. Vocabulary: Flashbulb Memory
- **Meaning**: A vivid, detailed memory of what someone was doing when they heard significant news, often lasting for years.
- **Pronunciation**: /FLASH-buhlb MEM-uh-ree/ (stress on "FLASH" and "MEM").
- **Part of Speech**: Noun.
- **Usage**: Used in discussions about memorable events, often tied to major news (e.g., disasters, assassinations).
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Can be thought of as "yaadgaar pal" (यादगार पल) or a memory that "flashes" vividly.

**Examples**:
1. **Positive**: I have a flashbulb memory of where I was when India won the World Cup.
2. **Negative**: I don’t have a flashbulb memory of that event because I was too young.
3. **Interrogative**: Do you have a flashbulb memory of a major news story?
4. **WH-Question**: What flashbulb memory do you have from your childhood?

**Situations**:
- **Professional (Procurement)**: Discussing significant industry events. E.g., "I have a flashbulb memory of when the new trade policy was announced."
- **Everyday**: Sharing personal memories. E.g., "My flashbulb memory is from when I heard about a family event."
- **Tip**: Use this term to describe vivid, emotional memories tied to big news.

### 2. Situational Usage and Practical Applications

As a procurement manager, you often recall past events (e.g., meetings, supplier interactions) or discuss interruptions during work, where the past continuous is useful. Below, I’ll explain how to use these structures in professional and everyday contexts, tailored to your role and intermediate level.

#### Professional Contexts (Procurement)
- **Meetings and Updates**: Use past continuous to describe what you were doing when an event occurred.
  - Example: "I was analyzing a vendor’s quote when the client called with urgent changes."
- **Supply Chain Incidents**: Describe ongoing actions interrupted by issues.
  - Example: "We were inspecting the warehouse when the delivery truck arrived late."
- **Flashbulb Memories**: Share vivid memories of significant work events.
  - Example: "I have a flashbulb memory of when our company won a major contract—I was negotiating with a supplier."
- **Daily Operations**: Explain interruptions during tasks.
  - Example: "While I was preparing a report, the supplier emailed about a delay."

**Tips for Professional Use**:
- Use "when" to highlight interruptions: "I was on a call when the system crashed."
- Use "while" for multitasking: "While I was reviewing contracts, I was also checking emails."
- Practice explaining work memories: "I was working on a tender when I heard about the new policy."

#### Everyday Contexts
- **Memories of Events**: Use past continuous to recall what you were doing during significant moments.
  - Example: "I was cooking dinner when I heard India won the cricket match."
- **Daily Activities**: Describe interruptions in routine.
  - Example: "While I was walking in the park, it started raining."
- **Flashbulb Memories**: Share vivid personal memories.
  - Example: "I have a flashbulb memory of where I was when I heard about a family wedding."
- **Storytelling**: Use "when" and "while" to make stories engaging.
  - Example: "When the phone rang, I was watching TV."

**Tips for Everyday Use**:
- Practice with familiar events like cricket matches: "I was cheering when India scored a goal."
- Use "while" for longer actions: "While I was shopping, I met a friend."
- Share memories to build confidence: "I was at home when I heard the news."
