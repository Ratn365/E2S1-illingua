### 1. Grammar Structures and Usage

The documents cover three key grammar structures: **past continuous**, **past simple**, and **present perfect**. I’ll explain each, its meaning, pronunciation (simplified for Hindi speakers), and usage. For each, I’ll provide:
- **Positive**, **negative**, **interrogative**, and **WH-question** sentences.
- **Situations**: Professional (procurement) and everyday contexts.
- **Tips for Hindi Speakers**: Relate to Hindi equivalents for clarity.

#### A. Past Continuous and Past Simple (Lesson 11 H.W.pdf)
- **Structure**: 
  - **Past Continuous**: Was/were + verb-ing (e.g., "I was working").
  - **Past Simple**: Verb + -ed or irregular form (e.g., "The phone rang").
  - Combined: "I was [verb-ing] when [past simple event happened]" (e.g., "I was working when the phone rang").
- **Meaning**: Describes an ongoing action in the past (past continuous) interrupted by a shorter, completed action (past simple).
- **Pronunciation**:
  - Past continuous: Stress the verb, e.g., "I was WORK-ing" (/I wuz WORK-ing/).
  - Past simple: Regular verbs end in /d/, /t/, or /id/, e.g., "rained" (/RAYND/).
- **Usage**: Used to set the scene for a past event, often with "when" to show the interruption.
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Similar to using "jab" (जब) with ongoing actions, e.g., "Main kaam kar raha tha jab phone baja" (मैं काम कर रहा था जब फोन बजा).

**Examples**:
1. **Positive**: I was emailing a supplier when the manager called me.
2. **Negative**: We weren’t discussing the contract when the client arrived.
3. **Interrogative**: Were you negotiating with the vendor when the power went off?
4. **WH-Question**: What were you doing when the shipment arrived?

**Situations**:
- **Professional (Procurement)**: Describing interruptions during work. E.g., "I was reviewing a quote when the supplier emailed me."
- **Everyday**: Recalling past events. E.g., "I was watching cricket when my friend called."
- **Tip**: Use past continuous for the ongoing action and past simple for the interruption. In Hindi, think of "jab" for "when."

# Discuss what they were doing.
#### B. Past Simple (Archie’s Birthday Gift)
- **Structure**: Verb + -ed or irregular form (e.g., "He bought a gift").
- **Meaning**: Describes completed actions in the past with no current relevance.
- **Pronunciation**: Regular verbs: /d/ (e.g., "agreed" /uh-GREED/), /t/ (e.g., "asked" /ASKT/), /id/ (e.g., "wanted" /WANT-id/).
- **Usage**: Used for narratives or sequences of past events.
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Simple past, e.g., "Maine kharida" (मैंने खरीदा) for a specific time.

**Examples**:
1. **Positive**: I bought a gift for my colleague last week.
2. **Negative**: I didn’t visit the supplier yesterday.
3. **Interrogative**: Did you pay for the order in cash?
4. **WH-Question**: What did you buy for the project last month?

**Situations**:
- **Professional (Procurement)**: Narrating past actions. E.g., "I ordered the materials last week."
- **Everyday**: Sharing past experiences. E.g., "I went to the market yesterday."
- **Tip**: Use past simple for specific, completed actions in the past.

#### C. Present Perfect (Grammar Worksheet)
- **Structure**: 
  - Positive: Have/has + past participle (e.g., "I have eaten").
  - Negative: Haven’t/hasn’t + past participle (e.g., "I haven’t eaten").
  - Question: Have/has + subject + past participle? (e.g., "Have you eaten?").
- **Meaning**: Describes actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past with relevance to the present.
- **Pronunciation**:
  - "Have": /HAV/ (short and simple).
  - "Has": /HAZ/ (stress on the "z" sound).
  - Contractions: "Haven’t" (/HAV-uhnt/), "Hasn’t" (/HAZ-uhnt/).
- **Usage**: Used to talk about experiences, recent actions, or unfinished states.
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Often translated as completed actions with current impact, e.g., "Maine kha liya hai" (मैंने खा लिया है).

**Examples**:
1. **Positive**: I have just finished a supplier meeting.
2. **Negative**: We haven’t received the shipment yet.
3. **Interrogative**: Have you ordered the materials?
4. **WH-Question**: What have you done to improve costs recently?

**Situations**:
- **Professional (Procurement)**: Reporting recent actions. E.g., "I have just negotiated a better price."
- **Everyday**: Sharing experiences. E.g., "I have lost my phone!"
- **Tip**: Use present perfect for actions without a specific time or with ongoing relevance.

### 2. Situational Usage and Practical Applications

As a procurement manager, you often discuss past events (e.g., supplier interactions) and recent actions (e.g., contract updates), where these grammar structures are highly relevant. Below, I’ll explain how to use them in professional and everyday contexts, tailored to your role and intermediate level.

#### Professional Contexts (Procurement)
- **Past Continuous and Past Simple**: Describe interruptions during work.
  - Example: "I was reviewing a contract when the supplier called with a delay."
- **Past Simple**: Narrate completed procurement actions.
  - Example: "Last week, I ordered new materials for the project."
- **Present Perfect**: Report recent actions with ongoing relevance.
  - Example: "I have just finalized a deal with a new vendor."
- **Daily Operations**: Combine structures for clarity.
  - Example: "While I was negotiating yesterday, the client called, and I haven’t responded yet."

**Tips for Professional Use**:
- Use past continuous for ongoing tasks: "I was checking inventory when…"
- Use past simple for completed actions: "I signed the contract last month."
- Use present perfect for updates: "I have just received the shipment confirmation."

#### Everyday Contexts
- **Past Continuous and Past Simple**: Recall daily interruptions.
  - Example: "I was cooking dinner when the phone rang."
- **Past Simple**: Share past experiences.
  - Example: "I bought a new phone last weekend."
- **Present Perfect**: Talk about recent events or experiences.
  - Example: "I have just finished cooking dinner."
- **Storytelling**: Use all structures to make stories engaging.
  - Example: "I was walking to the market when I met a friend, and I haven’t seen him since last year."

**Tips for Everyday Use**:
- Practice with familiar events: "I was watching cricket when India scored."
- Use past simple for sequences: "I went to the shop and bought groceries."
- Use present perfect for recent updates: "I have just seen the news!"

#### Ex 2: Complete the Sentences
1. I **was cooking** while my husband **was watching** a football match.
2. The children **were playing** indoors when it **was raining**. (*Note*: "when" here should ideally be "while" for simultaneous actions, as per the exercise’s intent: "The children were playing indoors while it was raining.")
3. The dog **was barking** when the thief **was robbing** the house. (*Note*: Should be "while" for consistency: "The dog was barking while the thief was robbing the house.")
4. Mary and Tom **were sleeping** when their mother **was knitting** a sweater. (*Note*: Should be "while".)

### 3. Present Perfect (Life Experiences)

#### Usage (from "04-17 PDF series"):
- **Present Perfect**: Describes experiences or actions with a connection to the present, often without specifying when.
- **Structure**: Subject + have/has + past participle.
- **Situation**: Use this to ask about or share life experiences (e.g., with "ever").
  - Example: Have you ever seen a thriller movie?

#### Revision: Present Perfect (Complete the Sentences)
1. Have you ever **seen** a thriller movie? – Yes, I **have seen** a thriller movie.

---

### Practical Application in Procurement
- **Past Continuous + Simple Past**: "I was negotiating with a supplier when the client called." (Describe interruptions during work.)
- **Past Continuous (Simultaneous)**: "I was reviewing contracts while my team was preparing the budget." (Show multitasking.)
- **Present Perfect**: "I have visited three supplier factories this year." (Share experiences relevant to your role.)

#### Connection to Travel Vocabulary ("04-28 U-6 K.P 6.1.pdf"):
- **Past Continuous + Simple Past**: "I was checking in at the desk when the security alarm went off."
- **Present Perfect**: "I have passed through passport control many times."

---

### Tips for Hindi Speakers
- **Hindi Influence (Past Continuous)**: Hindi uses a similar structure for ongoing actions (e.g., "मैं काम कर रहा था" /main kaam kar raha tha/ = "I was working"), but English requires "was/were + -ing." Avoid dropping "was/were" (e.g., wrong: "I working").
- **Hindi Influence (Present Perfect)**: Hindi often uses past tense for experiences (e.g., "मैंने झींगे खाए" /mainne jhinge khaye/ = "I ate prawns"). Use "have/has + past participle" in English: "I have eaten prawns."
- **Word Order**: Hindi uses Subject-Object-Verb (e.g., "मैं किताब पढ़ रहा था" = "I book reading was"). English uses Subject-Verb-Object: "I was reading a book."
- **Pronunciation**: Practice Past Continuous forms (e.g., "was working" /wəz ˈwɜːrkɪŋ/) and Present Perfect contractions (e.g., "I’ve" /aɪv/) to sound natural.

---

### Practice Exercise
1. Write 5 sentences using Past Continuous + Simple Past about your work:
   - Example: I was writing a report when the supplier emailed me.
2. Write 5 sentences using Past Continuous (simultaneous actions) about your day:
