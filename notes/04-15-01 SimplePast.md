### Tips for Hindi Speakers
- **Hindi Influence**: Hindi uses past tense markers (e.g., "था" /thā/ for "was"), but English requires "was" or "were" based on the subject. Avoid omitting them (e.g., "I born" → "I was born").
- **Word Order**: Hindi often uses Subject-Object-Verb (e.g., "मैं कल काम किया" = "I yesterday work did"). English uses Subject-Verb-Object: "I worked yesterday."
- **Irregular Verbs**: Memorize past forms (e.g., "go" → "went") from the word list, as Hindi verbs don’t follow this pattern.
- **Practice**: Repeat past tense sentences aloud, focusing on "was/were" and past verb endings (e.g., "I wrote" /raɪt/).

---

### Practice Exercise
1. Write 5 sentences about your yesterday using **was/were** and **Simple Past** (e.g., "I was tired, and I wrote an email").
