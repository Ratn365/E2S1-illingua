### Step 2: Situational Use in Your Professional Context

As a procurement manager, these terms are highly relevant when:
- **Traveling to Suppliers**: You might face a traffic jam or a delayed flight while heading to a supplier meeting, requiring you to inform your team.
- **Inspecting CapEx Projects**: Your car might break down or run out of fuel on the way to a project site, causing delays.
- **Managing Travel Costs**: You might need to request a refund for a canceled flight or pay a supplement for a last-minute train change.
- **Navigating Issues**: You could miss a connection or get lost while traveling to a new location, needing to explain the situation to colleagues or travel staff.

**Real-Life Scenarios**:
- **At the Airport**: You tell a colleague, “My flight was delayed, so I missed my connection.”
- **On the Road**: You call your team, “I’m stuck in a traffic jam because of rush hour.”
- **At the Station**: You ask, “Is my ticket valid, or do I need to pay a supplement?”

### Step 3: Practice Exercises for Speaking

To build fluency, practice these exercises tailored to your role and intermediate level:

1. **Role-Play: Explaining a Travel Problem**  
   Imagine you’re calling a supplier to explain why you’re late for a meeting. Practice aloud:
   - **You**: Hello, I’m sorry, but I’ll be late. I got lost on the way to your office. (Use “got lost.”)
   - **Supplier**: Oh no! How did that happen?  
   - **You**: There was a traffic jam, and my car broke down during rush hour. (Use “traffic jam,” “broke down,” “rush hour.”)

2. **Sentence Creation**  
   Create one positive, negative, interrogative, and WH-question sentence for each term, related to your work. Example for “delayed”:
   - Positive: My flight was delayed by two hours.
   - Negative: My train wasn’t delayed this morning.
   - Interrogative: Was your flight delayed yesterday?
   - WH-Question: Why was your train delayed?

3. **Describe a Travel Issue**  
   Narrate a fictional travel problem using at least 5 terms. Example:  
   “Last week, I traveled to a supplier meeting in Mumbai. My flight was delayed by an hour, so I missed my connection to Bangalore. At the airport, I found out my ticket was not valid for the next flight, and I had to pay a supplement. I also paid the full fare for a new ticket because I couldn’t get a refund. On the way to the hotel, I got stuck in a traffic jam during rush hour.”

4. **Complete the Document’s Exercises Aloud**  
   - **Follow-up 6.3**: Practice saying the completed sentences aloud, e.g., “I worried I’d miss the flight,” “I ran out of fuel,” “I got stuck in a traffic jam.”
   - **Practice Exercise 2**: Read the listening extracts aloud, e.g., “Your ticket was only valid on the last train,” “I can’t give you a refund.”

### Step 4: Tips for Improving Speaking

1. **Daily Practice**: Use one travel problem term per day in a sentence. For example, on Monday, use “traffic jam” in 5 sentences.
2. **Record Yourself**: Record the example sentences and listen to improve pronunciation (e.g., “delayed” = di-LAYD, “refund” = REE-fund).
3. **Hindi Bridge**: Translate sentences to Hindi first, then say them in English to build confidence.
4. **Watch Travel Videos**: Watch YouTube videos about travel problems (e.g., delayed flights) to hear terms in context.
5. **Practice with Colleagues**: Discuss travel issues with colleagues, using these terms to explain real or hypothetical problems.

### Step 5: Addressing Your Assessment

As an intermediate speaker, focus on:
- **Fluency**: Practice speaking without long pauses. Use the role-play exercise to simulate real conversations.
- **Vocabulary**: Memorize the 14 terms and use them in work-related contexts.
- **Pronunciation**: Pay attention to stress in words like “canceled” (CAN-suhld) and “supplement” (SUP-luh-muhnt).
- **Confidence**: Start with simple sentences (e.g., “My flight was delayed.”), then combine terms (e.g., “My flight was delayed, so I missed my connection.”).

### Step 6: Additional Notes

- The document’s exercises (e.g., completing sentences, listening extracts) are great for practicing these terms. Use them to reinforce your speaking skills.
- Keep a notebook with these terms and example sentences. Practice them when you face travel issues or discuss travel with colleagues.
- If you want to manage this conversation’s memory, you can click the book icon beneath the message and select this chat, or disable memory in “Data Controls” in settings.
