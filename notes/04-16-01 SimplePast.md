#### Part B: Paula Kraemer’s Points
Based on the listening (audio not accessible, but answers provided), Paula uses three examples:
1. **Biology**: She didn’t like biology and found it difficult, so she decided not to become a doctor.
2. **Literature**: Studying literature was important for her general education and culture, even if not directly career-related.
3. **Computers**: Technology changes quickly, so specific computer skills from school may not be relevant now, highlighting the need for adaptability.

#### Part C: Complete the Extract
"I **found** (1) it difficult. But it **taught** (2) me a lesson. It **was** (3) good experience."
- **Explanation**: Uses **Simple Past** ("found," "taught") for past events and "was" for a past state.

### Tips for Hindi Speakers
- **Hindi Influence**: Hindi uses past tense forms like "पढ़ा" /paḍhā/ (studied), but English requires specific verbs (e.g., "studied"). Avoid present forms (e.g., "I study" → "I studied").
- **Word Order**: Hindi uses Subject-Object-Verb (e.g., "मैंने गणित पढ़ा" = "I mathematics studied"). English uses Subject-Verb-Object: "I studied mathematics."
- **Irregular Verbs**: Use past forms (e.g., "find" → "found," "teach" → "taught") from prior lessons ("04-16 Lesson 6_H.W.pdf").
- **Pronunciation**: Practice past endings (e.g., "studied" /ˈstʌd.id/, "found" /faʊnd/) to avoid merging sounds.
