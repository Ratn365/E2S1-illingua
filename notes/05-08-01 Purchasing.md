### 15. Vocabulary for Purchasing

#### Concept: Key Terms for Buying and Selling
The document introduces vocabulary essential for the purchasing process, which you frequently encounter in procurement:
- **Order/Place an Order**: To request a product, often received later.
- **Pay/Payment**: To settle the cost, often by credit card in online purchases.
- **Confirm/Confirmation**: To verify the order via email or message.
- **Deliver/Delivery**: To send the product, often by truck for heavy items.
- **Ship**: To send the product, similar to deliver.
- **Invoice**: A document requesting or confirming payment.
- **Return**: To send a product back if unsatisfactory.
- **Exchange**: To swap a returned product for a new one.
- **Cancel/Cancelation**: To stop an order before it’s shipped.
- **Refund**: To get money back after returning a product.

#### When to Use:
- Use these terms when managing procurement processes, such as ordering materials, confirming deliveries, or handling returns with suppliers.
  - Example: "I’ll place an order for the new equipment tomorrow.”
  - Example: “Can you confirm the delivery date for the CAPEX items?”

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
As a procurement manager, you regularly order materials, confirm payments, and handle returns or refunds. This vocabulary helps you communicate clearly with vendors and your team.

#### Examples in Your Professional Context:
- **Positive**:
  - "I’ll deliver the invoice to the finance team tomorrow.”
- **Negative**:

### 16. Pronunciation: Stressing the Correct Syllable

#### Concept: Syllable Stress in Purchasing Vocabulary
The listening exercise (Listening 9.1) emphasizes pronouncing purchasing-related words correctly by stressing the right syllable. This is crucial for clear communication, especially in professional settings where mispronunciation can lead to misunderstandings.

Here’s the correct stress for each word (as per the answers):
- **Purchase**: PUR-chase (stress on the first syllable)
- **Refund (noun)**: RE-fund (stress on the first syllable)
- **Refund (verb)**: re-FUND (stress on the second syllable)
- **Exchange**: ex-CHANGE (stress on the second syllable)
- **Invoice**: IN-voice (stress on the first syllable)
- **Deliver**: de-LIV-er (stress on the second syllable)
- **Cancel**: CAN-cel (stress on the first syllable)
- **Cancelation**: can-cel-A-tion (stress on the third syllable)
- **Confirm**: con-FIRM (stress on the second syllable)
- **Confirmation**: con-fir-MA-tion (stress on the third syllable)

#### Practical Application in Your Role:
Correct pronunciation ensures vendors and colleagues understand you clearly. For example, saying “IN-voice” instead of “in-VOICE” makes your speech sound natural and professional.

#### Practice:
Say these sentences aloud, stressing the correct syllable:
- “I’ll PUR-chase the materials tomorrow.”
- “Can you con-FIRM the delivery date?”
- “We need to CAN-cel the order before they de-LIV-er it.”

#### Tips for Hindi Speakers:
- Hindi often stresses syllables more evenly, but English emphasizes specific syllables. For example, in Hindi, "invoice” might sound like "इन-वॉइस” with equal stress, but in English, it’s “IN-voice.”
- Practice by breaking words into syllables and exaggerating the stressed part (e.g., con-FIRM).

### Tips for Hindi Speakers:
- In Hindi, comparisons might use simple structures like "ये उससे बड़ा है" ("This is bigger than that”). English adds modifiers like “a lot” or “slightly” to show the degree of difference. Practice using these to be more precise.
- Hindi often repeats verbs for emphasis (e.g., "बहुत बहुत सस्ता है" = “very very cheap”), but English uses “much” or “far” (e.g., “much cheaper”). Avoid overusing “very” in English comparisons.
