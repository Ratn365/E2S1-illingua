# Conditional Sentences with “When” and “If”

**When to Use:**
- When: For situations that are certain or habitual (things that always happen in a specific condition).“When I negotiate with suppliers, I focus on cost.”
- If: For hypothetical or possible situations (things that might happen under certain conditions).“If the supplier offers a discount, I will sign the contract.”

**Structure:**
- When: When + present simple, present simple.
- If: If + present simple, will/can + base verb (for hypothetical outcomes).

Examples:
## When:
- Positive: When I review contracts, I find errors.
- Negative: When I don’t check prices, I miss savings.
- Interrogative: Do you save time when you use digital tools?
- WH-Question: What happens when you negotiate with vendors?

## If:
- Positive: If I find a reliable supplier, I will sign a long-term contract.
- Negative: If I don’t verify quality, I won’t approve the order.
- Interrogative: Will you reduce costs if you negotiate better?
- WH-Question: What will you do if the supplier delays delivery?

# Action vs. Activity (from “04-10 Group_Lesson 3 HW.pdf”)
** When to Use:** 
- Action: A specific, often temporary act (uses Present Continuous, e.g., “I am writing a report”).
- Activity: A general or habitual process (uses Simple Present, e.g., “Writing reports is my job”).

## Situations for Using Actions vs. Activities
 - Actions (Present Continuous):Use when describing what you or others are doing right now or in a specific, temporary context. 
    - Example: During a meeting, you might say, “I am writing notes” (specific action at the moment).
    - Professional use: “I am negotiating with a supplier now” (current task).
 - Activities (Simple Present or Gerund): Use when talking about general habits, routines, preferences, or descriptions of tasks.
    - Example: In a job interview, you might say, “Writing reports is part of my role” (general activity).
    - Professional use: “Negotiating with suppliers is my responsibility” (routine task).

## Situations in Your Context:
 - Action: “I am writing an email to a supplier” (specific moment).
 - Activity: “Writing emails is part of my job” (general task).

### Examples:
 ## Action (Present Continuous):
 - Positive: I am writing a procurement report now.
 - Negative: I am not writing a report today.
 - Interrogative: Are you writing an email?
 - WH-Question: What are you writing now?

## Activity (Simple Present): with gerund
A gerund is a verb form that functions as a noun in a sentence. It is created by adding -ing to the base form of a verb (e.g., run → running, write → writing).
 - Positive: I write reports every week.
 - Negative: I don’t write formal letters often.
 - Interrogative: Do you write emails daily?
 - WH-Question: Why do you write reports?

### Practice:
 - Pronunciation: Practice the -ing sound clearly (e.g., /ˈpreɪɪŋ/ for "praying"). Avoid merging it with Hindi sounds like "प्रेयिंग".
 - Practice: Use these verbs in sentences about your procurement work. For example, say, “I am writing a contract now” (action) vs. “Writing contracts is my job” (activity).
 - Write two sentences for each verb below, one describing an action (Present Continuous) and one describing an activity (Simple Present or gerund). Use your procurement context.
    - Verbs: negotiating, reviewing, communicating
    - Example: Negotiating:
    - Action: I am negotiating a deal with a supplier now.
    - Activity: Negotiating is a key part of my job.

#### Exercise 2: Identify action or activity:
 - I am praying – action (specific moment).
 - Playing cricket is my hobby – activity (general).
 - I enjoy reading – activity (general preference).
 - They are reading – action (now).
 - Playing golf is interesting – activity (general).
 - I am playing golf – action (now).
 - He is writing – action (now).
 - Writing is harder than reading – activity (general).



## Practical Application for Your Role
To improve your speaking as a procurement manager, practice these structures in professional scenarios:

 - Simple Present: Describe your job: “I manage supplier relationships and ensure quality materials.”
 - Present Continuous: Discuss current tasks: “I am negotiating a new contract today.”
 - When/If: Explain processes: “When I find a cost-effective supplier, I prioritize them. If they delay delivery, I look for alternatives.”
 - Action vs. Activity: Clarify tasks: “I am writing a report now (action). Writing reports is my responsibility (activity).”

**Practice these**
 - Pronunciation: Practice -s and -es sounds (e.g., “works” /wɜːrks/, “goes” /ɡoʊz/).
 - Use the exercises from the documents to create sentences about your work.
 - Record yourself speaking and compare with native speakers (e.g., audio from inlingua.com).
 - Practice WH-questions to improve fluency in meetings: “What do you think about this supplier?”
